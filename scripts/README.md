# Advent of Code Input Downloader

This script is used to download the puzzle input for a particular day of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Advent of Code is an annual event where programmers compete by solving a series of puzzles.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Your Advent of Code session cookie

## Usage

1. Set the `COOKIE` environment variable to your Advent of Code session cookie
2. Run the script with the day number as a command line argument, for example:

```
node download-puzzle-input.js 5
```

This will download the puzzle input for day 5 of Advent of Code and save it to a file called `input.txt` in the `day-05` directory.

## Code Overview

This script uses the `https` module to make a GET request to the Advent of Code website and download the puzzle input for a given day. The day is specified by a command line argument, and the user's session cookie is stored in the `COOKIE` environment variable. The downloaded input is then saved to a file in the `day-${day}` directory.
