# Advent of code 2022
There are a collection of the solutions I implemented for [advent of code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/)!

# Running
## Haskell
To simply run a haskell script, without needing to set up the project
```bash
runhaskell <filename>.hs
```

## Typescript
```bash
npm start
```

This will print the outcomes for all days. If you only wish to print the outcomes up until day N, you can do so such:

```bash
npm start N
```

Example:
```bash
npm start 6
```
will show you the outcomes up until, and including, day 6
