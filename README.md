# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022 challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## Directory structure

The root of the repository contains a folder for each day of the challenge, named `01_calorie-counting`, `02_rock-paper-scissors`, etc. Each day's folder contains a script that contains my solution for that day. The solutions are written in either Haskell or TypeScript.

In addition, the `/scripts` folder contains utility scripts that automate some tasks for me.

## Usage

To use the solutions in this repository, clone the repository and run the `npm run start` script located in the root directory. You can do this by running the following command from the root directory:

```
npm run start
```

This will run all of the solutions in the repository.

To run the solutions for only a specific day, you can pass the day number as an argument to the `npm run start` command. For example, to run the solutions for day 1, you can use the following command:

```
npm run start 1
```

To run the solutions for all days up until a specific day, you can use the --until flag followed by the day number. For example, to run the solutions for all days up until day 5, you can use the following command:

```
npm run start -- --until 5
```

If the solution for a specific day is written in Haskell, you will need to use `runhaskell` to run it, like this:

```
runhaskell <location>/main.hs
```
