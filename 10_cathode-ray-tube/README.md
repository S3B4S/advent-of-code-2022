# Day 10: Cathode-Ray-Tub

This is a solution for [day 10 of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10): Cathode-Ray Tube. It is written in TypeScript and includes two solutions for two different parts of the problem.

## Usage

To use the solution, import it in your TypeScript code:

```ts
import { solvePart1, solvePart2 } from './day-10-solution'
```

Then, pass the input to either solvePart1 or solvePart2 to get the respective solution.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the solution:

```
import { solvePart1, solvePart2 } from './day-10-solution.ts'

const input = Deno.readTextFileSync('./10_cathode-ray-tube/input.txt')

console.log(solvePart1(input))
// Output: 13140

console.log(solvePart2(input))
// Output:
// ████  ██  █     ██  █  █ █    ███   ██  
// █    █  █ █    █  █ █  █ █    █  █ █  █ 
// ███  █  █ █    █    █  █ █    █  █ █    
// █    ████ █    █ ██ █  █ █    ███  █ ██ 
// █    █  █ █    █  █ █  █ █    █    █  █ 
// ████ █  █ ████  ███  ██  ████ █     ███ 
```

## Details

The solution includes two functions for solving two different parts of the problem. The first function, solvePart1, takes an input string containing a series of commands, and returns the sum of the values recorded at intervals of 40 cycles, starting at the 20th cycle. The second function, solvePart2, takes the same input string, but draws pixles on a screen according to the value of the register.
