# Day 09: Rope Bridge

This code contains two functions for simulating the movement of knots in a grid. It was used to solve [day 9 of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/9).

## `part1Fn`

The `part1Fn` function simulates the movement of a single knot in a grid. It takes a list of `Direction` values and distances as input, and moves the knot according to the input. The function uses a `Set` to keep track of the visited coordinates by the last know, and returns the number of unique coordinates.

## `part2Fn`

The `part2Fn` function simulates the movement of a number of knots in a grid. The knots are initially located at `(0, 0)` and the function takes a list of `Direction` values and distances as input, and moves the knots according to the input. The function uses a `Set` to keep track of the visited coordinates by the last knot, and returns the number of unique coordinates.

## Types and helper functions

The code also defines the `Direction` type, which can be one of `'R'`, `'U'`, `'L'`, or `'D'`. It also uses the following helper functions:
- `range`: returns an array of numbers between a start and end value.
- `adjacentTo`: checks whether two coordinates are adjacent to each other (i.e. if the absolute difference between their `x` and `y` values is less than or equal to 1).
- `moveTowards`: moves a coordinate in a given `Direction`.
- `moveCloserTo`: moves a coordinate towards another coordinate, in a direction that brings the two coordinates closer together.

## `printMap`

The `printMap` function prints a map of the coordinates visited by a set of knots. It takes the dimensions of the map, the starting coordinates of the map, a `Set` of visited coordinates, and the current locations of the knots as input. The map is printed to the standard output stream.

Here is an example of the output of the `printMap` function at an intermediate step when it is run against the example input on the site:

```
..##..
...##.
1H###.
....#.
####..
```

And here is an example when run against the example input for part 2:
```
